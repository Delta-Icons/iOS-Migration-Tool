# Delta iOS Migration Tool
This tool allows you to search the iOS App Store for possible matches of existing themed Android icons and automatically generate named files and a list of the icons that can be matched.

## Development
To run the tool locally for development or because it is offline simply clone the repo and run the following commands in the root folder:
```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Other automated tasks
To manually build a deployable version run `yarn build`. `yarn lint` allows you to lint the code with ESLint.
